This in the CFG folder of the TF2 Bot Detector to detect the newest and most frequent bots from South America.

In addition to bots it includes cheaters of real people.

## How to install the config?

2. Config Steam API Key: [Click](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector/wiki/Integrations:-Steam-API#how-to-generate-and-use-your-steam-web-api-key)
3. Download the latest available release of my configuration and paste the "/cfg" folder into your home directory.
4. Done! Detect bots and cheaters ;)

## Will this get me VAC banned?

No. It does not modify the game or OS memory in any way. It is only using built-in functionality in the engine, exactly the way it was intended. Anecdotally, many users have been using this tool for many years now without issue.
